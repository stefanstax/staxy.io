### BINDING ARBITRATION

In the event that either party asserts that there is a dispute arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, such party shall first notify the other party in writing, specifying the
nature of the dispute and scheduling a meeting to attempt to resolve the dispute.

If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) calendar days of the delivery of the written
notice, either party may then elect to exclusively and finally resolve the dispute by
binding arbitration by filing a written notice of arbitration in accordance with this section
under the subheading “Binding Arbitration” and the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration
of the International Chamber of Commerce applicable at the time of submission of the
dispute to arbitration (the “ICC Rules”).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ICC Rules, the following terms and
conditions shall apply.

The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall
have the right to appoint one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the delivery
of the written notice of arbitration, and a third arbitrator shall be selected by those two
(2) party-appointed arbitrators within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the two (2)
party-appointed arbitrators.

The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Republic of Serbia in the Serbian language.

The parties shall equally bear the costs and fees of the arbitration, and each party shall
bear its own cost for its own legal expenses. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive
law set forth in the section of this Agreement under the subheading “Governing Law”.
Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted on a confidential basis.

The arbitrators shall specify the reason and basis for their decision, the reason for any
damages awarded and the breakdown for such damages awarded, and the basis for
any other remedy authorized under this Agreement, including but not limited to
injunctive relief or specific performance. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.

The decision of the arbitrators shall be considered as a final and binding resolution of
the dispute, shall be final and binding on the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal
or reexamination. The award of the arbitrators may be entered as a judgment and
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE
YOUR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDINGS, ACTION OR
COUNTERCLAIM.

### INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

and intellectual property. All actions or proceedings related to this Agreement that are
not subject to binding arbitration will be brought solely Republic of Serbia.
You hereby unconditionally and irrevocably consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of those courts for purposes of
any such action.
